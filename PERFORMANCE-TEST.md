# 🚀 Performance Diagnostic Guide

## Step 1: Restart Dev Server (CRITICAL!)

```bash
# Kill the current server completely
# Press Ctrl+C in terminal

# Clear Next.js cache
rm -rf .next

# Restart fresh
npm run dev
```

## Step 2: Open Browser Console

1. Open your app in browser
2. Press F12 to open DevTools
3. Go to "Console" tab
4. Clear console (trash icon)

## Step 3: Test Navigation

Click any sidebar link and watch the console. You should see:

```
🔵 [PERF] Navigation started to: /feeds/messages
🟢 [PERF] Page interactive after: 87.45ms  ✅ GOOD!
```

If you see:
```
🔵 [PERF] Navigation started to: /feeds/messages
⚠️ [PERF] SLOW NAVIGATION DETECTED! 3245.67ms  ❌ BAD!
🟢 [PERF] Page interactive after: 3245.67ms
```

Then copy the console output and share it with me!

## Step 4: Check Network Tab

1. Open DevTools → Network tab
2. Click "Disable cache" checkbox
3. Navigate to a page
4. Check which requests are slow

Look for:
- API calls taking > 1 second
- Large JavaScript bundles (> 500KB)
- Images loading slowly

## What We Fixed So Far:

✅ React Strict Mode disabled (was causing double renders)
✅ RTK Query cache enabled (60s TTL)
✅ ProfileSection using cache
✅ Removed polling intervals
✅ Removed loading.tsx files
✅ Added "use client" to pages

## Expected Results After Restart:

- First navigation: ~500ms (fresh data fetch)
- Subsequent navigations: < 100ms (cached data)
- Console should show timing < 1000ms

## If Still Slow:

The PerformanceLogger will tell us EXACTLY how long navigation takes.
Share the console output and we'll find the bottleneck!
