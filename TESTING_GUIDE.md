# 🔍 Performance Testing Guide (For Non-Testers)

## 🎯 Easy Ways to Find What's Causing Lag

### ✅ **Method 1: Visual Performance Monitor (EASIEST)**

I've added a **Performance Monitor** widget to your app. You'll see it in the bottom-right corner.

**What to do:**

1. Open your app: `http://localhost:3000`
2. Look for the **📊 icon** in bottom-right corner
3. Click it to open the monitor

**What the monitor shows:**

- 🔢 **Renders**: How many times the page re-rendered
  - ✅ Good: 1-5 renders
  - ⚠️ Bad: 10+ renders (too many, causes lag)
- 🌐 **API Calls**: How many times it fetched data
  - ✅ Good: 1-3 calls per page
  - ⚠️ Bad: 5+ calls (too much, causes lag)
- 🐌 **Slow API Calls**: Calls taking more than 1 second
  - ✅ Good: 0 slow calls
  - ⚠️ Bad: 1+ slow calls (backend is slow)

**Example of what you'll see:**

```
✅ Performance OK
Renders: 3 ✅
API Calls: 2
Slow API Calls: 0 ✅
Memory: 45 MB

Recent API Calls:
✅ 234ms: /api/v1/users/current
✅ 456ms: /api/v1/profiles/full
```

---

### ✅ **Method 2: Browser Console (SIMPLE)**

**Open Console:**

- Press `F12` on keyboard
- OR Right-click → "Inspect" → "Console" tab

**What to look for:**

#### 1. **Red Errors** ❌

```
❌ Error: Failed to fetch
❌ TypeError: Cannot read property...
```

→ Something is broken

#### 2. **Yellow Warnings** ⚠️

```
⚠️ SLOW API Call (2456ms): /api/v1/...
⚠️ Component re-rendered 10 times
```

→ Performance issue

#### 3. **Blue Info** ℹ️

```
🌐 API Call: /api/v1/users/current
✅ Performance OK
```

→ Normal behavior

---

### ✅ **Method 3: Network Tab (CHECK API SPEED)**

**Open Network Tab:**

1. Press `F12`
2. Click "Network" tab
3. Navigate to any page

**What to check:**

| Speed    | Status    | What it means    |
| -------- | --------- | ---------------- |
| < 500ms  | ✅ Fast   | Good!            |
| 500ms-1s | ⚠️ Medium | Okay             |
| > 1s     | 🐌 Slow   | Backend is slow! |
| Failed   | ❌ Error  | API broken       |

**Example:**

```
Name                          Status    Time
/api/v1/users/current         200 OK    234ms ✅
/api/v1/profiles/full         200 OK    3456ms 🐌 SLOW!
/api/v1/connections           500 Error ❌ BROKEN!
```

---

### ✅ **Method 4: Simple Click Test**

Do this test to see if lag is fixed:

1. **Test Navigation Speed**

   ```
   ✅ Click "My Profile" → Should load instantly
   ✅ Click "Connections" → Should load instantly
   ✅ Click "Events" → Should load instantly
   ```

   If any takes > 2 seconds = Problem!

2. **Test Tab Switching**

   ```
   ✅ Click on page
   ✅ Switch to another browser tab
   ✅ Come back to the app
   ```

   Should NOT reload or lag = Good!

3. **Test Scrolling**

   ```
   ✅ Scroll up and down quickly
   ```

   Should be smooth, no stuttering = Good!

## 🚨 Common Issues & What They Mean

### Issue 1: "Renders: 15 ⚠️"

**Problem**: Page re-rendering too many times
**Cause**: State updates triggering unnecessary re-renders
**Solution**: Already fixed with RTK Query optimization

### Issue 2: "Slow API Calls: 3 🐌"

**Problem**: Backend API is slow
**Cause**: Backend server or database is slow
**Solution**:

- Check if backend server is running
- Check backend server logs
- Optimize backend queries

### Issue 3: "API Calls: 10"

**Problem**: Too many API requests
**Cause**: Not using cache properly
**Solution**: Already fixed with `refetchOnFocus: false`

### Issue 4: "Memory: 500 MB"

**Problem**: Using too much memory
**Cause**: Memory leak in components
**Solution**: Restart dev server

## 📊 How to Read the Performance Monitor

### Example 1: **Good Performance** ✅

```
✅ Performance OK
Renders: 2 ✅
API Calls: 1
Slow API Calls: 0 ✅
Memory: 45 MB

Recent API Calls:
✅ 234ms: /api/v1/users/current
```

→ Everything is working perfectly!

### Example 2: **Too Many Renders** ⚠️

```
⚠️ Performance Issues Detected
Renders: 15 ⚠️
API Calls: 2
Slow API Calls: 0 ✅
Memory: 87 MB

Recent API Calls:
✅ 234ms: /api/v1/users/current
✅ 456ms: /api/v1/profiles/full
```

→ Page is re-rendering too much (state updates issue)

### Example 3: **Slow Backend** 🐌

```
⚠️ Performance Issues Detected
Renders: 3 ✅
API Calls: 3
Slow API Calls: 2 🐌
Memory: 52 MB

Recent API Calls:
✅ 234ms: /api/v1/users/current
🐌 2456ms: /api/v1/profiles/full
🐌 3120ms: /api/v1/connections
```

→ Backend server is slow (needs optimization)

## 🎯 Quick Actions

### If Seeing Too Many Renders:

1. Open Performance Monitor
2. Click "Reset Stats"
3. Navigate to problem page
4. Check render count
5. If > 10, there's a state update issue

### If Seeing Slow API Calls:

1. Open Network tab (F12)
2. Find the slow request
3. Check response time
4. If > 1 second, backend needs optimization

### If Seeing Many API Calls:

1. Open Performance Monitor
2. Check "Recent API Calls" list
3. See if same URL appears multiple times
4. If yes, caching is not working

---

## 🛠️ Quick Fixes

### Fix 1: Reset Everything

```bash
# In terminal:
npm run fresh
```

### Fix 2: Clear Browser Cache

1. Press `Ctrl + Shift + Delete`
2. Select "Cached images and files"
3. Click "Clear data"

### Fix 3: Restart Dev Server

```bash
# Stop current server (Ctrl+C)
# Start again:
npm run dev:turbo
```
